## GitHub Actions Workflow Explanation

The `.github/workflows/main.yml` file defines a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and deployment process. Here's a breakdown of the file:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline  # The name of the workflow

on:  # Specifies the events that trigger the workflow
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # Trigger the workflow on pushes to the master branch

jobs:  # Defines the jobs to be executed in the workflow
  build:  # The name of the job
    name: Build and Test  # A descriptive name for the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Specifies the type of machine to run the job on

    steps:  # Defines the steps to be executed in the job
      - name: Checkout code  # A descriptive name for the step
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Uses the actions/checkout@v3 action to checkout the code

      - name: Set up Node.js  # A descriptive name for the step
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3  # Uses the actions/setup-node@v3 action to set up Node.js
        with:
          node-version: 16  # Specifies the version of Node.js to use

      - name: Install dependencies  # A descriptive name for the step
        run: npm install  # Runs the npm install command to install dependencies

      - name: Run tests  # A descriptive name for the step
        run: npm test  # Runs the npm test command to run tests

  deploy:  # The name of the job
    name: Deploy to Production  # A descriptive name for the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Specifies the type of machine to run the job on
    needs: build  # Specifies that this job needs the build job to complete successfully

    steps:  # Defines the steps to be executed in the job
      - name: Checkout code  # A descriptive name for the step
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Uses the actions/checkout@v3 action to checkout the code

      - name: Deploy  # A descriptive name for the step
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."  # Runs the echo command to simulate deployment
```

To create a GitHub Actions workflow:

1.  Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2.  Create a YAML file (e.g., `main.yml`) inside the `.github/workflows` directory.
3.  Define the workflow, specifying the name, trigger events, jobs, and steps.
4.  Commit the changes and push them to your repository.
